	<title>Writing to memory</title>

	To write contents to the address space of another program you must
	call the <quote>proctal_write</quote> function. It takes a handle, an
	address in the program, a pointer to a buffer and the number of bytes
	to write as arguments and returns the number of bytes written.

	<code type="c">
void *address = (void *) 0x1C09346;
int i = 0;
size_t bytes_written = proctal_write(proctal, address, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
	</code>

	You must make sure that it's possible to read from the given buffer up
	to the given number of bytes.

	If the returned number is not equal to the given number, then an error
	must have occurred. Check the <link doc="error-handling.xml">Error
	handling</link> page to learn how to deal with an error.
