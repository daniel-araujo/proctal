	<title>Writing to memory</title>

	Writing to memory is quite simple. Just call
	<quote>proctal_write</quote>. Here's how you would write an int to
	memory location <quote>1C09346</quote>.

	<code type="c">
void *address = (void *) 0x1C09346;
int i = 0;
size_t bytes_written = proctal_write(proctal, address, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
	</code>

	This call returns the number of bytes written. If that number doesn't
	match the size of the value, then an error must have occurred. Call
	<quote>proctal_error</quote> to find out what went wrong.
