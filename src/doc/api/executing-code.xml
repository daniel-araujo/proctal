	<title>Executing code</title>

	You can make a program start executing your code by calling
	<quote>proctal_execute</quote>.

	The given instructions will be embedded at some place in memory and
	executed in a new stack frame in the context of the main thread. The
	other threads will be paused. Your code is free to modify any registers
	because they will be restored to their original values. Control will
	be given back to the program after the last instruction is executed.

	The instructions cannot rely on where they will be placed in memory.

	Here's how you would make a program execute 3 NO OPS on x86-64:

	<code type="c">
proctal_execute(proctal, "\x90\x90\x90", 3);
	</code>

	To check if something went wrong, call <quote>proctal_error</quote> to
	get an error code.
