	<title>Reading from memory</title>

	To read contents from the address space of another program you must
	call the <quote>proctal_read</quote> function. It takes a handle, an
	address in the program, a pointer to a buffer and the number of bytes
	to read as arguments and returns the number of bytes read.

	<code type="c">
void *address = (void *) 0x1C09346;
int i;
size_t bytes_read = proctal_read(proctal, address, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
	</code>

	You must make sure that it's possible to write to the given buffer up
	to the given number of bytes.

	If the returned number is not equal to the given number, then an error
	must have occurred. Check the <quote>Error handling</quote> page to
	learn how to deal with an error.
