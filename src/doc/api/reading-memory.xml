	<title>Reading from memory</title>

	Reading from memory is quite simple. Just call
	<quote>proctal_read</quote>. Here's how you would read an int at memory
	location <quote>1C09346</quote>.

	<code type="c">
void *address = (void *) 0x1C09346;
int i;
size_t bytes_read = proctal_read(proctal, address, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
	</code>

	This call returns the number of bytes read. If that number doesn't match
	the size of the value, then an error must have occurred. Call
	<quote>proctal_error</quote> to find out what went wrong.
