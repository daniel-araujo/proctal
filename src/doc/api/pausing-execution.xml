	<title>Pausing execution</title>

	You can pause the execution of a program by calling the
	<quote>proctal_pause</quote> function. It takes a handle as argument.

	<code type="c">
proctal_pause(proctal);
	</code>

	Check the <quote>Error handling</quote> page to learn how to deal with
	an error.

	To resume execution you must call the <quote>proctal_resume</quote>
	function. It takes a handle as argument.

	<code type="c">
proctal_resume(proctal);
	</code>

	You must only call <quote>proctal_resume</quote> after having
	successfully called <quote>proctal_pause</quote> otherwise behavior is
	undefined.

	Closing a handle while the program is paused results in undefined
	behavior.

	You may call other functions on the handle while the program is paused.

	Calling <quote>proctal_pause</quote> again without calling
	<quote>proctal_resume</quote> beforehand results in undefined behavior.
