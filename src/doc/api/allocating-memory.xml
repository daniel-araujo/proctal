	<title>Allocating memory</title>

	You can allocate and deallocate memory for a program by calling
	<quote>proctal_allocate</quote> and <quote>proctal_deallocate</quote>,
	respectively.

	The function <quote>proctal_allocate</quote> takes the size of the
	memory block. Here's how you would allocate 8 bytes in memory.

	<code type="c">
void *address = proctal_allocate(proctal, 8);
	</code>

	The function returns the address where the memory location starts. On
	error the address will have the value <quote>NULL</quote> and you can
	call <quote>proctal_error</quote> to find out what went wrong.

	Access permissions can be defined by calling
	<quote>proctal_allocate_read_set</quote>,
	<quote>proctal_allocate_write_set</quote> and
	<quote>proctal_allocate_execute_set</quote> before
	<quote>proctal_allocate</quote>. By default all access permissions are
	set.

	Once you are done using the memory block, you need to deallocate with
	<quote>proctal_deallocate</quote>. You just need to pass it the address
	you got from <quote>proctal_allocate</quote>.

	<code type="c">
proctal_deallocate(proctal, address);
	</code>
