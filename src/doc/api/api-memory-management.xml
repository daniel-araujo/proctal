	<title>API memory management</title>

	The API makes calls to <quote>malloc</quote> and <quote>free</quote> to
	allocate and deallocate memory, respectively, for its internal data
	structures.

	If you're the kind of programmer that wants to have complete control
	over every memory allocation, you can provide your own versions of
	malloc and free.

	Here's how you would tell the API to use your custom
	<quote>malloc</quote> and <quote>free</quote>:

	<code type="c">
void *my_malloc(size_t size)
{
	// Allocate memory however you like.
}

void my_free(void *memory)
{
	// Deallocate your chunk of memory.
}

proctal_global_malloc_set(&amp;my_malloc);
proctal_global_free_set(&amp;my_free);
	</code>

	Just make sure that you do this before calling any other function of
	the API. You wouldn't want your version of <quote>free</quote> being
	called with an address returned by the wrong <quote>malloc</quote>.
