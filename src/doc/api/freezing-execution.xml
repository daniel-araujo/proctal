	<title>Freezing execution</title>

	You can freeze the execution of a program by calling
	<quote>proctal_freeze</quote>.

	<code type="c">
proctal_freeze(proctal);
	</code>

	Call <quote>proctal_error</quote> to find out if the function failed.
	Freezing twice results in undefined behavior.

	If freezing was successful, you can call
	<quote>proctal_unfreeze</quote> to unfreeze the program. You should
	only call this function if you had previously called
	<quote>proctal_freeze</quote>, otherwise behavior is undefined.

	<code type="c">
proctal_unfreeze(proctal);
	</code>

	Closing the handle without unfreezing first results in undefined
	behavior.
