	<title>Freezing execution</title>

	You can freeze the execution of a program by calling
	<quote>proctal_freeze</quote>.

	<code type="c">
int result = proctal_freeze(proctal);
	</code>

	It returns <quote>1</quote> on success, <quote>0</quote> on failure.
	In case of failure you can call <quote>proctal_error</quote> to find
	out what went wrong.

	If freezing was successful, you can call
	<quote>proctal_unfreeze</quote> to unfreeze the program.

	<code type="c">
int result = proctal_unfreeze(proctal);
	</code>

	Again, it returns <quote>1</quote> on success, <quote>0</quote> on
	failure. You can call <quote>proctal_error</quote> to find out what
	went wrong.
