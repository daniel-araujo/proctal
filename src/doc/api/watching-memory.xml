	<title>Watching memory</title>

	You can watch for reads, writes and code execution at a chosen address.

	To choose the address, you must call
	<quote>proctal_watch_set_address</quote>.

	<code type="c">
proctal_watch_set_address(proctal, (void *) 0x81AC27);
	</code>

	To choose whether you watch to watch for reads, writes or code
	execution you either call <quote>proctal_watch_set_read</quote>,
	<quote>proctal_watch_set_write</quote> or
	<quote>proctal_watch_set_execute</quote>, respectively.

	<code type="c">
proctal_watch_set_read(proctal, 1);
proctal_watch_set_write(proctal, 1);
proctal_watch_set_execute(proctal, 1);
	</code>

	With that set you can start watching for memory accesses by calling
	<quote>proctal_watch</quote>.

	<code type="c">
void *address;
int result = proctal_watch(proctal, &amp;address);
	</code>

	The call will block until an access is detected.

		The behavior of this function is most likely going to change in
