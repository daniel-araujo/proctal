	<title>Freezing execution</title>

	You can use the <quote>freeze</quote> command to pause a program.

	Here's how you would pause a program whose PID is 12345:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal freeze --pid=12345
	</code>

	The program will remain paused as long as the command is running. You
	can stop the command by sending it the <quote>SIGINT</quote> signal
	(<quote>^C</quote> on most terminals).

	You may optionally pass the <quote>--input</quote> parameter that will
	additionally make the command quit when the standard input stream is
	closed.
