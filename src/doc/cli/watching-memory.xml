	<title>Watching memory</title>

	With the <quote>watch</quote> command you can get the value of the
	instruction pointer the moment after a memory address is read, written
	or executed.

	You may pass the <quote>--read</quote> option to watch for reads,
	the <quote>--write</quote> option to watch for writes and the
	<quote>--execute</quote> option to watch for execution.

	If you were to watch the memory address <quote>1c09346</quote> for
	reads and writes on the program whose PID is 12345, the command would
	look like this:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal watch --pid=12345 --address=1c09346 --read --write
	</code>

	The command will print the value of the instruction pointer after
	detecting that the given memory address was accessed. Note that the
	the instruction pointer may not actually be pointing at the instruction
	that actually accessed the memory address.

	You can stop the command by sending it the <quote>SIGINT</quote> signal
	(<quote>^C</quote> on most terminals).

	The <quote>--address-start</quote> option specifies where to start the
	<quote>--address-stop</quote> option specifies where to stop detecting
	accesses.

	If you're seeing the same address get printed several times it might be
	helpful to use the <quote>--unique</quote> option that will make the
	command print an address only once.
