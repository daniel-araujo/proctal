	<title>Watching memory</title>

	Suppose that you know the address of a value in memory and you're
	interested in finding out what reads it. With the <quote>watch</quote>
	command you can do just that.

	You may pass the <quote>--read</quote> parameter to watch for reads,
	the <quote>--write</quote> parameter to watch for writes and the
	<quote>--execute</quote> parameter to watch for execution.

	If you wanted to watch for reads and writes at the memory address
	<quote>1c09346</quote> on the program whose PID is 12345, the command
	would look like this:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal watch --pid=12345 --address=1c09346 --read --write
	</code>

	Any time that memory address is accessed, the command will print the
	address of the instruction when it was detected. That instruction may
	not actually be the instruction that accessed the memory address.

	You can stop the command by sending it the <quote>SIGINT</quote> signal
	(<quote>^C</quote> on most terminals).

	If you're seeing the same address get printed several times it might be
	helpful to use the <quote>--unique</quote> parameter that will make the
	command print an address only once.
