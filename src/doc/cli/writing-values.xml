	<title>Writing values</title>

	With Proctal not only can you read the contents in memory straight from
	your terminal, you can also easily modify them. The
	<quote>write</quote> command is able to write text, integers, IEEE754
	floating point numbers, CPU instructions and more.

	The command accepts type parameters. You can find out all about them
	<link ref="proctal:cli:type-parameters">here</link>.

	Here's how you would write a 32-bit integer with the value 0 at the
	memory address <quote>7FFE79DEA90C</quote> in a program whose PID is
	12345.

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal write --pid=12345 --address=7FFE79DEA90C --type=integer --integer-size=32 0
	</code>

		<title>Writing arrays</title>

		But what if you had an array of 32-bit integers in memory? One
		way to write all the elements would be to execute the
		<quote>write</quote> command at the corresponding address for
		each element. But a better way is to take advantage of the
		<quote>--array</quote> parameter. It takes the number of
		elements as its value.

		Here's how you would write an array of 5 32-bit integers.

		<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal write --pid=12345 --address=7FFE79DEA90C --type=integer --integer-size=32 --array=5 0 0 0 0 0
		</code>

		You can also let the command loop back to the first value if
		you don't provide the same number of values as the
		<quote>array</quote> parameter. This means that the previous
		command is equivalent to this one:

		<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal write --pid=12345 --address=7FFE79DEA90C --type=integer --integer-size=32 --array=5 0
		</code>

	<section>
		<title>Repeat writing</title>

		With the <quote>--repeat</quote> parameter you can make the
		command repeatedly write the same values over and over again.
		With the <quote>--repeat-delay</quote> parameter you can even
		specify the delay in milliseconds between writes.

		The command will keep running until you tell it to stop. You
		can stop it by sending it the <quote>SIGINT</quote> signal
		(<quote>^C</quote> on most terminals).

		By default the delay is set to be 5 milliseconds.
