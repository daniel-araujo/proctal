	<title>Allocating memory</title>

	To allocate a block of memory you can use the <quote>allocate</quote>
	command.

	You may optionally pass the <quote>--read</quote>,
	<quote>--write</quote> and <quote>--execute</quote> options to set
	the permissions of the block. It is possible to allocate memory without
	any permissions.

	Here's how you would allocate 8 bytes that are readable and writable
	for the program whose PID is 12345:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal allocate --pid=12345 --read --write 8 
	</code>

	It will print the starting address of the block of memory.

	When you're done, you have to deallocate the block by passing the same
	address to the <quote>deallocate</quote> command. If the address were
	<quote>7FFE79DEA90C</quote>, the command would look like this:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal deallocate --pid=12345 7FFE79DEA90C
	</code>
