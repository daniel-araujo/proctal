	<title>Executing code</title>

	With the <quote>execute</quote> command you can make a program execute
	your code. You can either provide assembly instructions that will then
	get assembled into byte code or you can provide the byte code yourself,
	maybe hand-written or assembled by your favorite assembler.

	The command for executing code from an assembly file for a program
	whose PID is 12345 looks like this:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal execute --pid=12345 &lt; code.asm
	</code>

	The given instructions will be embedded at some place in memory and
	executed in a new stack frame in the context of the main thread. The
	other threads will be paused. Your code is free to modify any registers
	because they will be restored to their original values. Control will
	be given back to the program after the last instruction is executed.

	If you'd rather execute byte code instead you would pass the
	<quote>--format</quote> option with the value
	<quote>bytecode</quote>.

	Here's how you would execute byte code from a binary file:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal execute --pid=12345 --format=bytecode &lt; code.bin
	</code>
