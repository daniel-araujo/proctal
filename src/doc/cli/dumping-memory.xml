	<title>Dumping memory</title>

	With the <quote>dump</quote> command you can dump the contents in
	memory to a file.

	Here's how you would dump everything in memory of the program whose PID
	is 12345:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal dump --pid=12345 &gt; dump.bin
	</code>

	You may optionally pass parameters to only dump certain portions in
	memory. You may pass <quote>--program-code</quote> if you only want to
	dump the code, <quote>--read</quote> for readable memory,
	<quote>--write</quote> for writable memory and <quote>--execute</quote>
	for executable memory. These can be combined.
