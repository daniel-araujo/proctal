	<title>Type parameters</title>

	Commands that deal with values such as <quote>read</quote>,
	<quote>write</quote>, <quote>search</quote> and <quote>measure</quote>
	take a common set of parameters that are called the type parameters.
	These parameters are used to describe the value.

	The <quote>--type</quote> parameter specifies the type of the value.
	The following types are available:

	<list>
		<item>byte</item>
		<item>integer</item>
		<item>ieee754</item>
		<item>text</item>
		<item>address</item>
		<item>instruction</item>
	</list>

	The following sections will describe each one and their specific
	parameters.

	<section>
		<title>Byte</title>

		This is the most basic type of them all. A byte is a sequence
		of 8-bits. It is printed in hexadecimal notation.

		This type does not have type specific parameters.
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Integer</title>

		An integer number can be represented in various ways. Proctal
		supports 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit wide integers, either unsigned or
		using the two's complement representation for negative numbers
		and in little endian. It's printed with decimal numbers.

		The <quote>--integer-endianness</quote> parameter can be used
		to set the endianness. At the time, only <quote>little</quote>
		is supported.

		The <quote>--integer-size</quote> parameter can be used to set
		the number of bits. Only <quote>8</quote>, <quote>16</quote>,
		<quote>32</quote> and <quote>64</quote> are supported at the
		moment.

		The <quote>--integer-sign</quote> parameter can be used to set
		the sign representation. <quote>2scmpl</quote> uses two's
		complement. <quote>unsigned</quote> disregards signing
		altogether.

		By default an integer is 8-bit, signed using two's complement
		and in little endian notation.
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>IEEE754</title>

		These numbers are represented as defined by the IEEE 754-1985
		standard. It's printed with decimal numbers.

		The <quote>--ieee754-precision</quote> parameter allows you to
		pick the precision. You may use <quote>single</quote>,
		<quote>double</quote> or <quote>extended</quote>.

		By the default a floating point number uses single precision.
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Text</title>

		Text is a single character from a character set. It's printed
		in UTF-8.

		The <quote>--text-charset</quote> parameter defines the
		charater set to use. At the moment the only value that is
		supported is <quote>ascii</quote>.

		By default text uses the ASCII encoding.
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Address</title>

		This represents a memory address in the computer. It's printed
		in hexadecimal notation.

		This type does not have type specific parameters.
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Instruction</title>

		This represents a CPU instruction. It's printed in assembly.

		The <quote>--instruction-arch</quote> parameter defines the
		architecture of the instruction. At the moment only
		<quote>x86-64</quote> is supported.

		By default the architecture is the same as the tool was
		compiled in.
