	<title>Pausing execution</title>

	You can use the <quote>pause</quote> command to pause program
	execution.

	Here's how you would pause a program whose PID is 12345:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ proctal pause --pid=12345
	</code>

	The program stays paused as long as the command is running. You can
	stop the command by sending it the <quote>SIGINT</quote> signal
	(<quote>^C</quote> on most terminals).
