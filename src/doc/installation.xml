	<title>Installation</title>

	You can download the latest version of Proctal from
	<link ref="proctal:download">here</link>.

	Additionally you're going to need:

	<list>
		<item><link ref="gcc">GCC</link></item>
		<item><link ref="libtool">libtool</link></item>
		<item><link ref="capstone">capstone</link></item>
		<item><link ref="keystone">keystone</link></item>
	</list>

	With all that set, you can now go through the 3 step installation
	process that is employed by many C programs released in source code
	form on Linux:

	<code type="bash-prompt">
$ ./configure

$ make

$ make install
	</code>

	The configure script checks whether your system meets the minimum
	necessary requirements and allows you to define how you want Proctal to
	be compiled and installed. Run `./configure -h` if you want to learn
	more about that.
