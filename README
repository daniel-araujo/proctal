# Proctal 0.0.0

Proctal provides a command line interface and a C library to manipulate the
address space of a running program on Linux. It can be used like a process
memory editor or to provide the base functionality for building one that is
domain-specific.

**Note:** This is work in progress and as such the API is unstable and the
documentation is done as an afterthought. This will change as the project
matures.

Features:
- Reading and writing values in memory
- Searching for values with a vast combination of filters

Planned:
- Showing disassembly of instructions
- Overwrite instructions directly from assembly mnemonics
- Freezing values in memory
- Read watch points
- Write watch points
- Integer types from a combination of size, signing convention and endianness
- Reading and writing text
- Reading and writing multiple values in contiguous memory
- Specifying floating point comparison precision
- Freezing execution
- Allocating and deallocating memory manually


## Example

### CLI

Assuming `22002` is a Process ID (PID):

	$ proctal search --pid=22002 > result

	$ cat result
	9a3654 40
	acfa08 109
	acfe90 394
	b683f8 1055
	b7d178 56
	b84ab0 192
	ba2e38 1264
	[...]

	$ wc -l result
	1634

	$ proctal search --pid=22002 --gt=31 --lt=110 -i < result
	9a3654 40
	acfa08 109
	b7d178 56

	$ proctal write --pid=22002 --address=b7d178 124

	$ proctal read --pid=22002 --address=b7d178
	124


### C library

A program that takes a Process ID (PID) and an address to an integer value as
arguments and reads the value then increments by 1 each time it's run.

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <sys/types.h>

	// Declares proctal's functions.
	#include <proctal.h>

	int main (int argc, char **argv)
	{
		if (argc == 1) {
			printf("Usage: %s <pid> <address>\n", argv[0]);
			return 0;
		} else if (argc != 3) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Incorrect number of arguments.\n");
			return 1;
		}

		pid_t pid;

		if (sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &pid) != 1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse process id.\n");
			return 1;
		}

		void *addr;

		if (sscanf(argv[2], "%lx", (unsigned long *) &addr) != 1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse address.\n");
			return 1;
		}

		proctal p = proctal_create();

		if (p == NULL) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create a Proctal instance.\n");
			return 1;
		}

		proctal_set_pid(p, pid);

		int read;

		// Attempts to read an int from an other process. May fail if
		// your program does not have permission to access the address
		// space of other processes.
		if (proctal_read_int(p, addr, &read) != 1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Failed to read from %p of process %d.\n", addr, pid);
			return 1;
		}

		printf("Read %d from address %p of process %d.\n", read, addr, pid);

		// Just going to increment the read value.
		int write = read + 1;

		// Attempts to write an int to an other process. May fail if
		// your program does not have permission to access the address
		// space of other processes.
		if (proctal_write_int(p, addr, write) != 1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Failed to write to %p of process %d.\n", addr, pid);
			return 1;
		}

		printf("Written %d to address %p of process %d.\n", write, addr, pid);

		return 0;
	}


## Usage

### CLI

The command line interface can be used in the following ways:

	proctal read [--type=<type>] --pid=<pid> --address=<address>

	proctal write [--type=<type>] --pid=<pid> --address=<address> <value>

	proctal search [--type=<type>] [--eq=<val>] [--gt=<val>] [--gte=<val>]
		[--lt=<val>] [--lte=<val>] [--inc=<val>] [--dec=<val>]
		[--changed] [--unchanged] [--increased] [--decreased]
		[--input] --pid=<pid> --address=<address>

For more details run `proctal -h` or read the man page:

	man 1 proctal


### C library

Can be used by linking to libproctal and including proctal.h

Available functions are documented in the header file.


## Installation

Proctal provides a 3 step installation process employed by many C/C++ programs
on Linux:

	$ ./configure

	$ make

	$ make install

The configure script allows you to define how you want Proctal to be compiled
and installed. For more information type `./configure -h`.


## Development

Proctal uses the autotools to generate build systems for UNIX like operating
systems. I will provide instructions on how to get you quickly started to
generate a development build.

To get the autotools ready for use, you will need to run `autoreconf` with the
`-i` option:

	$ autoreconf -i

You will notice that now there are new files and directories in the project.
These were generated by `autoreconf` and can be ignored.

With the tools ready to use, you can now generate a build. I recommend using
different build directories for different purposes. Here's how you can create
a build that suppresses optimizations and adds debugging symbols:

	$ mkdir -p build/debug

	$ cd build/debug

	$ ../../configure 'CFLAGS=-g -O0'

So with a build system in place, you can now start compiling by running the
`make` command in your build directory:

	$ make

If you modify a source file and run `make` again it should detect the change
and recompile again.

For tinkering with the source code this is the least you need to know about
the build system. For more details on what you can do with the autotools read
the manuals over at gnu.org [[1]].
